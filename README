MobDebug is a remote debugger for Lua.

MobDebug allows you control the execution of another Lua program remotely,
set breakpoints, and inspect the current state of the program.

MobDebug is based on [RemDebug](http://www.keplerproject.org/remdebug/) and
extends it in several ways:

1. fixed several existing bugs;
2. added new commands: LOAD, RELOAD, OUT, STACK;
3. added support for [MoSync](http://mosync.com/) using [MobileLua](https://github.com/divineprog/mobilelua);
4. added support for debugging wxwidgets applications;
5. tested integration with [ZeroBrane Studio IDE](http://studio.zerobrane.com/);
6. removed dependency on LuaFileSystem;
7. added ability to pause and abort running applications;
8. added pretty printing and handling of multiple results in EXEC;
9. added stack and local/upvalue value reporting (STACK);
a. added on/off commands to turn debugging on and off (to improve performance);
b. added support for coroutine debugging (see examples/README for details);
c. added support for [Moai](http://getmoai.com/) debugging.

INSTALLATION

Make src/mobdebug.lua available to your script.
See examples/README and examples/*.lua for examples of how to use the module.

DEPENDENCIES

MobDebug depends on LuaSocket 2.0 and has been tested with Lua 5.1.

HISTORY 

v0.51 (Dec 13 2012)
  - Added yield callback to customize event loop call during debugging.
  - Added custom error handler for start() call to report errors remotely.
  - Added serialization of remote 'print' results.
  - Added 'output' command to redirect 'print' remotely.
  - Added turning JIT off under LuaJIT to get reliable debug hook calls.
  - Added setting/using global vars in a way that is 'strict.lua' friendly.
  - Changed default port to 8172. Added setting port # using MOBDEBUG_PORT.
  - Updated license to add remdebug license information.
  - Upgraded to Serpent v0.20 to add serialization of metatables with 
    __tostring and fix serialization of functions as shared keys.
  - Fixed using correct environment after the main script is done.

v0.50 (Oct 05 2012)
  - Improved path matching when absolute and relative paths are used.
  - Improved performance; thanks to Stephen Nichols for profiling and
    detailed suggestions.
  - Added conversion of file names on Windows to lower case to make
    x:\Foo and X:\foo to match in breakpoint checks.
  - Added reporting errors in deserializing stack data.
  - Fixed an issue with returning stack values with circular references.
  - Fixed serialization of usedata values that don't provide tostring().
  - Fixed an issue with wx IDLE event on Linux.

v0.49 (Sep 03 2012)
  - Added support for unicode names in load and breakpoint commands.
  - Added conversion to short path for unicode names on windows.
  - Added handling of exit/load/reload commands after watch condition is fired.
  - Added support for moai breakpoints and callback debugging.
  - Fixed an issue of starting debugging too early in some cases using start().
  - Fixed an issue with coroutine debugging.
  - Fixed an issue with yielding to wxwidgets apps while running main loop.

v0.48 (Aug 05 2012)
  - Added support for coroutine debugging. Added methods (coro/moai) to
    support coroutine debugging without adding 'on()' calls to all coroutines.
  - Added on/off methods to turn debugging on and off (to improve performance).
  - Fixed an issue with localized variables not being properly restored
    if there are multiple variables with the same name in the environment.
  - Added restoring variables between stack calls to make them reflect changes
    that can be caused by EXEC/EVAL commands.
  - Fixed compilation errors on scripts with a shebang line.

v0.47 (Jun 28 2012)
  - Added special handling to debug clients running under LuaJIT.
  - Fixed an issue when a remote client could not suspend/exit.
  - Added default configuration for start/loop/listen methods.
  - Relaxed safety checks to allow debugging lua code called from C
    functions (to support debugging Love2d and similar applications).
  - Fixed incorrect initial stack level when started with start() command.
  - Added short_src field to the reported stack data.

v0.46 (Jun 19 2012)
  - Added reporting of stack and variable (local/upvalue) information.
  - Added support for multiple results returned by EXEC/EVAL commands.
  - Added serialization/pretty-printing of results from EXEC/EVAL.

v0.45 (May 28 2012)
  - Added select() implementation to mosync client to abort/break a running
    mosync app.
  - Added support for scratchpad.
  - Added SUSPEND command to suspend execution of a running script.
  - Added 'loadstring' command to load chunks of code to run under debugger.
  - Added safety mechanism to LOAD/RELOAD to avoid aborting when there are
    C functions in the stack.
  - Added reset for loaded modules to get 'require' to be processed correctly
    after LOAD/RELOAD commands.
  - Added integration with MobileLua event loop to allow debugging of
    applications that require event loop processing.
  - Improved handling and reporting of run-time errors during debugging.
  - Fixed handling of multi-line fragments with comments executed with EXEC/EVAL.
  - Fixed exit from the debugger when the application throws an error.
  - Fixed an issue with saving/restoring internal local variables.
  - Fixed an issue with local variables not being updated after EXEC/EVAL
    commands.

v0.44 (Mar 20 2012)
  - Updated to work with "mosync" namespace (MobileLua 20120319 and MoSync 3.0).
  - Removed the use of "module()".

v0.43 (Jan 16 2012)
  - Fixed errors from LOAD/RELOAD commands when used with start() method.
  - Added reporting of a file name and a line number to properly display
    source code when attach to a debugger.

v0.42 (Dec 30 2011)
  - Added support for debugging of wxwidgets applications.
  - Added ability to break an application being debugged; this requires
    socket.select and async processing (doesn't work from the command line).

v0.41 (Dec 17 2011)
  - Added slash conversion in filenames to make breakpoints work regardless
    of how slashes are specified in file names and in setb/delb commands.
  - Added tests with breakpoints in files in subfolders.
  - Added optimization for filename processing in the debug hook
    (Christoph Kubisch).
  - Added conversion of newlines for EVAL/EXEC commands to make them work
    with multiline expressions.
  - Allowed 'setb' and 'delb' commands to accept '-' as the filename.
    The last referenced (checked/stopped at/etc.) filename is used.

v0.40 (Dec 02 2011)
  - First public release.
